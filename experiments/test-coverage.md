# Test coverage

This report is generated from the central claim ledger, experiment documents,
and reviewed ledger-only dispositions. It distinguishes a written protocol from
runnable software. Re-run `npm run audit:tests` after changing claim links,
experiment contracts, or disposition fragments.

## Current answer

The four rows below are mutually exclusive highest-reached tiers.

| Highest coverage tier | Claims | Share of 1496 | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| ledger-only | 92 | 6.1% | no exact direct relation to a numbered experiment artifact |
| linked test description | 0 | 0.0% | related experiment prose exists, but at least one required protocol facet is absent |
| protocol-complete test contract | 1404 | 93.9% | at least one linked artifact contains all eight required facets |
| workstation-executable | 0 | 0.0% | checked execution manifest and runnable scientific harness exist |

The short answer is therefore **1404 claims have a complete
test description, but 0 are executable on the workstation**.
Across both description tiers, 1404 claims have an exact direct
relation to at least one experiment artifact. These are aggregate candidate
tests: they evaluate engineering translations supported by several claims; they
do not independently reproduce every source paper.

## Coverage by evidence status

| Highest tier | Established | Plausible | Speculative | Disputed | Unknown |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ledger-only | 79 | 9 | 0 | 4 | 0 |
| linked-description | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| protocol-complete | 1082 | 206 | 60 | 47 | 9 |
| workstation-executable | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

## Why ledger-only claims remain unlinked

A reviewed disposition explains every ledger-only claim without counting the
classification itself as a test.

| Disposition | Claims | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| evidence-input | 81 | scientific or engineering evidence that constrains a translation but is not itself a standalone AI-system hypothesis |
| source-reproduction | 11 | a source-domain result whose direct test would reproduce the cited study rather than evaluate this project's AI system |
| existing-artifact-gap | 0 | an engineering consequence belongs in an existing artifact, but its exact traceability or track is still missing |
| new-artifact-needed | 0 | a project engineering hypothesis needs a new experiment contract |

No unresolved `new-artifact-needed` disposition remains. Promoted family
records are retained as design provenance in the
[experiment-family provenance](proposed/README.md). The source fragments and
schema are in [claim dispositions](claim-dispositions/README.md).

## What “complete test description” means

A protocol passes only when the document contains all of the following:

- question or hypothesis;
- system, scenario, or task family;
- arms, baselines, or strongest nulls;
- matched budget and cost boundary;
- measurements and units;
- ablations;
- analysis or statistical plan;
- rejection, kill, or retirement rule;

The gate scans explicit H2/H3 sections. Cost reporting alone does not satisfy
resource parity, and a statistical null is not a confirmatory analysis plan.
This is a structural completeness gate, not proof that the design is correct.
A workstation-ready test additionally needs a machine-readable manifest naming
the command, environment, hardware assumptions, seeds, data, and outputs.

## Traceability method

A relation exists when either side states it exactly:

1. a claim block links a numbered candidate or fixture; or
2. an artifact links an exact claim label to the matching claim anchor.

Inclusive ranges are expanded only when both endpoints have exact matching
links. Prose numbers and indirect adoption-matrix associations do not count.
The union yields 1404 linked claims: 1187
appear on the claim side, 1104 on the document side, and
750 have at least one reciprocal same-artifact relation.

## Artifact coverage

There are 41 experiment artifacts: 41
pass the written-protocol gate, a validated smoke harness exists for
4, and 0 pass the full execution gate.
Smoke readiness verifies deterministic plumbing but cannot promote a claim.

## Immediate gaps

- 92 claims remain ledger-only: 81
  evidence inputs, 11 source-domain
  reproductions, and 0 claims needing
  a new project experiment artifact.
- 0 ledger-only claims still belong
  in an existing artifact but lack an exact traceability or test track.
- 0 claims reach only a partial description.
  The missing facets are concentrated in no artifact.
- 4 artifact(s) have a validated smoke manifest and
  deterministic harness. They remain non-executable for claim coverage until
  confirmation seeds, held-out generators, complete analysis, resume and
  corruption checks, and measured-energy instrumentation satisfy the
  [workstation contract](workstation/README.md).

## Machine-readable report

[`test-coverage.json`](test-coverage.json) contains every claim-to-artifact
mapping, reviewed ledger-only disposition, per-artifact facet result, and
execution readiness.
